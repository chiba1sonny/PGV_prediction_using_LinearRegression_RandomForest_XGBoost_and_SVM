# PGV prediction using Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM
## PGV
Peak ground velocity, an earthquake intensity.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00220
## Introduction
Develop new attenuation relationships of peak ground velocity using Linear regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor and SVM Regressor.
## Dataset
9734 ground motion records at 1699 seismic observation stations which were observed during the 32 earthquakes from 1997 to 2011 in Japan are employed.
